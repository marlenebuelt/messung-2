# Software-based Measurement
This is a repository of all analysis files I used for my bachelor's thesis. 
For these measurements, the [PowerJoular](https://joular.github.io/powerjoular/) tool is used.

All measurement files are found in the corresponding folders:
powerjoular_[model].csv - Power utilization log
processes_[model].log - Log of memory utilization
[model].csv - runtime logs
